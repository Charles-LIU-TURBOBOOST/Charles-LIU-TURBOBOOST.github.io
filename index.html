            <p>​        Problem cannot be avoided in our study life, no matter how careful you try to finish your work or study. This type of circumstance is especially usual in the process of writing code. Program is the thing that require plenty of carefulness and precision that needs the logic way of code and strict sequence of each line of code. If the final result of my program is not correct, it needs a lot of time for me to find the bug inside my code because sometimes I have to check the code line by line to make sure that is working well. One of experience of mine was writing a small program that can be used as a simple calculator. The procedure of this is quite smoothly. However, this calculator can only do the basic addition and subtraction and cannot be further used to do multiplication and division. I have first checked the grammar mistaken, but after the correction, the program still did not work. Myself spent around 1 hours to rewrite several times and could not find the solution. Therefore, I had to go to ask my classmates to read my code and ask teacher as well to edit it. It is important to do things independently, but moreover it is difficult for a person to check his own mistakes and correct it without the help from peer teammates and teachers. </p>

            <p>​        Automatic Drive is one of the most outstanding conjectures for humanbeings. For several decade, thousands of sectors like Goole and Microsoft are chasing for completing the actual car that can help the drive to achieve the unmanned drive.</p>

<p>​     First things first, a 3-D printer is essentail for this process in order  to print out the comopents of the car in which needs solid works( A software ) to help build the 3-D model in the computer and save them as binary file to print them out. Moreover, the 3-D printer is also absolutely fascinating. For people who learn about the Integration(definite integral), they must learns about the priciple which the area under the curve, is the sum of areas  of infinite small rectangles with extremly small width multiply its corresponding height.</p>
<p>3-D print use the similar priciple, it dose not print the model in just one time but in fact, the model is made up of many small printed lines. The printer first print the frame of model and then use the plastic lines to fill the frame up.</p>
<p>​    Secondly, when the car model is printed successfully and   the electric machineries are combined, an aduino chip is needed  to control the movement of the wheels. The language that used on wrting code in</p>
<p>aduino chip is just C which I have learnt before the start of event. So it is not very difficult stuff for me.</p>
<p>Thirdly, a camera is needed to locate on the top of the car to transfer the signal to the aduino chip to control the speed when the camera scans different colors.The language that used in OPEN MV (to control the camera) is python and I am not familiar with this language, a little of help from teacher is essential and I </p>
<p>am sure that I will learn this in this year</p>

            <h1 id="The-impacts-of-social-media-on-youth-generation"><a href="#The-impacts-of-social-media-on-youth-generation" class="headerlink" title="The impacts of social media on youth generation"></a>The impacts of social media on youth generation</h1><p>​      Appling the highly convenient telecommunication tools has been become commonly seen in young people’s life due to social media platforms have been developed rapidly. <strong>Social media are simply those digital technologies that allow users to easily create and share material with others via the internet. (poore, 2014)</strong> Platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Wechat have already given us lots of benefits in our life through educating ,mental health and expanding the relationships meanwhile it has also provided drawbacks like causing health problems and performance problems. Some people consider that the advantages of social media outweigh the disadvantages while others disagree with this opinion.</p>
<h3 id="Advantages-of-social-media"><a href="#Advantages-of-social-media" class="headerlink" title="Advantages of social media"></a>Advantages of social media</h3><p>Social media platform has become one of the easiest ways for students to study. For instance, they can help the students to create their own content, to find the available studying materials. According to the article “Studying and researching with social media” written by Megan Poore (2014), “social media tools are flexible, easy to use and often very powerful. In theory, this should lead to the types of socially constructivist learning approaches that students and class focused rather than teacher driven” (poore, 2014) . Further examples that illustrate social media can help to study are interacting with tutors, getting the assessment from the lecturers. Many lecturers are now using social media platforms to assess their students’ work. Also, “lectures who use social media in their teaching typically want the students who are involved to share , communicate , distribute their materials in a socially constructivist learning environment.” (poore, 2014) So , platforms like blogs, Wechat, Facebook are the excellent choices of the tutors meanwhile the lecturers also hope that their students can use this kind of technology as a skill when they leave the university or later in their working careers. (poore, 2014) Additionally, studies have proved that students want more information on how to learn with social media and not on how to make things work in technical sense (Educause/JISC, 2012/2007/2008). Moreover, social media can help the young to improve communication and strengthening human connection. Social media applications like Instagram provides a suitable region for the young to build on existing relationships, make new friends, and reinvigorate relationships that have lapsed over time (Unknown, 2019).The author of “Pros and cons of social media” also mention that “social media has exponentially increased the resources for mental health information and support. Research shows that people who get support from peers (those struggling with the same problems) have better outcomes.” This is because the social media create a group of peers and can help the young to get support from their peers. (Unknown, 2019) However, for the first article, the writer is a professional writer and might have relevant expertise about the social media, and he did quote the evidences which comes from the experts who have high reputation. For the second the author did not say the source of the research that he wrote in the article, and himself did not mention his name and not use any clear evidences to prove his perspective, so this article is relatively weaker and can not support the main idea strongly</p>
<h3 id="Disadvantages-of-social-media"><a href="#Disadvantages-of-social-media" class="headerlink" title="Disadvantages of social media"></a>Disadvantages of social media</h3><p>On the other hand, social media may also cause some serious problems like mental health issue. Just as the author said in the article “<strong><em>Does Social Media Cause Depression?\</em></strong> <strong><em>“ . (Miller)\</em></strong>      </p>
<p>“by 2015 fully 92 percent of teens and young adults owned a smartphone and a study of over half a million eighth through 12th graders found that the number exhibiting high levels of depressive symptoms increased by 33 percent between 2010 and 2015. (Twenge., 2017) The study has already proved the increase of high level of depressive symptoms is related to the increasing use of the mobile phone which might caused by the social media platforms. Moreover “Another possible source of depression may be what teenagers are not doing during while they’re spending time on social media, including physical activity and learning things that is very beneficial for their future career.” Doctor Hamlet, PsyD, a clinical psychologist at the Child Mind Institute, proposed that ““If you’re spending a lot of time on your phone, you have less time for activities that can build confidence, a sense of achievement and connectedness. ”Dr . Hamlet also said that it seems that the social media can help students to chat with each other about the subjects that they have learnt, but actually it would cut down the their performance because “What you end up doing is really just switching back and forth between two tasks rather quickly. There is a cost to the brain.” Said by Dr .Hamlet.</p>
<p>The author of this article is a editorial director of the Child Mind Institute and she is a veteran magazine, newspaper and website editor who was editor-in-chief of New York Magazine which means that she tends to show the truth to the reader and she must gets relevant expertise about the effects of the social media. Also, the authority called Child Mind Institute which is a well-known organisation that has great reputation. In this article , the author has used the experts’ evidences （including statistical data, survey, primary evidences）to support her perspective .</p>
<h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Obviously, the negative side of social media article is better than the positive side due to the author of the last article apply the variable types of evidence. In addition, the authors of the second article “Pros and cons of social media” did not provide any source of the evidence and even did not mention his own name. Thus, the it is extreme weak, and can not support his idea strongly. Therefore, the article of negative sides of the social media is better than the positive one and the disadvantages outweigh the advantages.</p>

            <p>Hey, guys. Today I am going to show you some materials about studying and today’s subject is GPR essay.</p>
<p>This essay was my first essay which is written by myself. I know it is not very good, but this essay is extreme <code>meaningful</code> to me and for my future essay writing.  </p>
<h1 id="Is-the-global-trade-fair-enough-for-every-country"><a href="#Is-the-global-trade-fair-enough-for-every-country" class="headerlink" title="Is the global trade fair enough for every country?"></a>Is the global trade fair enough for every country?</h1><h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>​       Nowadays, trades between most countries has increased and global trade is the worldwide business that involves making and collecting payments for transactions in goods and services, and transporting them to interested markets”. (Business dictionary, n.d.)  This issue is important because some developing countries have suffered from the unfair retribution from selling their products to other nations .Currently, this trend has been become an irreversible process of human economic development.(and that is the reason why I chose it.)  Benefits such as importing goods which have high quality meanwhile it will also cause some serious problems like destruction of domestic producers and raising global poverty between in developing countries. Kimberly Amadeo, a woman president of WorldMoneyWatch, a firm which produces publications about the global economy proposes that global trade is unfair and probably leads to several problems. However, another woman called Nergis,   an Import Operations Manager at MTS Logistics suggests that global trade is extreme excellent for almost every nation.</p>
<p>Reasons why we need to maintain the global trade (part 1)</p>
<p>​        The first which is the most significant is that global trades can boost the variety of commodities and services. To be more specific, globalization can help the local citizens to know exotic cultures and foreign goods and no countries are now in self- sufficient. The author of the article “The Impact of Global Trade on Our Daily Lives” has posted a real example that the lamb you eat is from New Zealand, the sea food that you enjoy might come from Norway. The trades allow shipping firms to transport other countries ‘food like Japanese fish to satisfy the consumers’ demand and can provide sufficient goods for consumers to have .Of course, with the help of globalization, more people are now having better living condition which has variable choices of services and commodities and every nation which is involved in the trades can improve their economic circumstances and great ideas and invention can be shared by each country.” A fact that Amado mentioned is NAFTA, a free trade area between the United States, Canada, and Mexico. In this area, many commodities can be transported easily without restriction. Therefore, many companies might provide the thousand types of new goods in order to sell more and survive in the keen competition. An evidence from the online article “International Trade: Pros, Cons, and Effect on the Economy “and it says that Imports would add pressure on domestic producers so that they would lower the prices of goods and provide shoppers with a wider variety of goods and services, such as different types cars in order to attract more potential consumers (Amadeo, 2020). International trade provides different companies in different regions choose goods that producing the goods which they are good at producing. For instance, the firm which sited near the forest might be good at producing wooden products while the other firm which is constructed near the sea might have excellent fishing skills. Therefore, those firms can produce what they are good at and can have lower cost of production compared with producing both two goods by themselves. Thus, when it comes to a whole country, people in nation A can enjoy the goods at a lower price and a much higher quality from nation B and vice versa. “The Impact of Global Trade on Our Daily Lives” said “Personally, I love the idea of being able to find the ethnic ingredients of my mother’s favourite dish here in New York, thousands of miles away from its origin, sometimes for cheaper prices than in its local market.” The author Kimberly Amadeo, a person who has over 20 years of senior-level corporate experience in economic analysis, business strategy and graduated from the Sloan School of Business at MIT. She is a very experienced expert in the field of economics and business and it shows that she must have some related expertise to the topic of globalization. An expert in this field might have the abilities to select the proper evidence and choose the academic style. She showed us the real example of an outcome of the global trade which is NAFTA, this example is a fact and strength the topic. For the second author whose name is Nergis, a person who was the Import Operations Manager at MTS Logistics. She graduated from Istanbul University majoring in Tourism &amp; Hotel Management. Her major might be not relevant to the business and economics, but her job which was an import operation manager, she probably had relevant experience. However, her position which is a manager of shipping firm made herself might have vested interest. Being as manager of the shipping firm, she has the probability to say some things that are beneficial for her corporation. From her first opinion which is globalization can help the local citizens to enjoy the food come from other nations, other areas. But she did not use any other details to reinforce her perspective and just made assumptions by herself. However, she used her personal experience (primary evidence) to support her perspective.</p>
<p>The reasons that why some people do not believe the global trade</p>
<p>​       Everything has its dual characters, there are some of the drawbacks of the globalization. International business might destroy the domestic producers so that cause unemployment. In Kimberly Amadeo’s article, she pointed that “The only way boost exports are to make trade easier overall. Governments do this by reducing tariffs and other blocks to imports. That reduces jobs in domestic industries that can’t compete on a global scale, as well as leads to job outsourcing, which is when companies relocate call centres, technology offices, and manufacturing to countries with a lower cost of living.” One of example that she has mentioned is “United States has a trade deficit. In 2019, international trade subtracted $616 billion from GDP ﻿(Data on America’s import and export components show that goods and services purchased by the nation outweigh those which it sells on the global marketplace)”. In general, the trade deficit means the exports revenue less than the expenditure on imports. If this situation continues exits, it means domestic producers and workers are really weak due to its consumers mainly depends on imports instead of the domestic supply. Therefore, producers do not have sufficient profit to maintain the corporations so that they need to reduce the number of workers to decline the cost. Globalization means competitions between each producer. For several firms, they are not able to compete with the other business men who produce the identical goods at lower prices which we called the substitute. For another article called “negative effects of world trades” (Hall, 2017) , writer proposed that it will cause reduced wages and raising global poverty. “Labour represents one of the highest business costs in producing products. The EPI reported that expanded world trade – which opens markets to goods produced in countries where workers earn far less than their domestic competitors.” The domestic producers are now trying to reduce the cost of production in order to compete with the other foreign which produce identical goods. Obviously, the cost of employing workers and staff account for the most expenditure of production and many entrepreneurs have no choice but to reduce the wages for employees. Thus, employees might have lower financial conditions and worser living standards. Despite this problem, rising global poverty is another serious issue which many countries have. “The World Trade Organization and the World Bank report that the years since 1980 have seen the most growth in liberalized trade, in which international trading activities expand as trade barriers fall. However, world poverty has risen during that same period. The World Bank reports that the number of people throughout the world living on less than $2 a day has risen by about 50 percent since 1980. In addition, a growing number of people are living on less than $1 a day.” Written by Shane Hall (Hall, 2017). Part of the developing countries cannot produce their goods at a lower price compared with the developed nation who have skilled labour and advanced machines(capitals).Therefore, the domestic producers might get bankrupts and their circumstances are getting worsen and worser but by contrast , the producers in developed nations might get richer. Overall, Amadeo is a very experienced expert who has relevant expertise that we mention in the second paragraph. The author of the second article is a writer and analyst with over 20 years of experience and he also got a Doctor of Philosophy in the political economy and is a former college instructor of economics and political science. So，Shane Hall, might have expertise as well. For both of the writers, they have abilities to give logical explanation and they have applied quantitive data and figures to claim their topic and meanwhile Shane Hall cite the research of World Bank which is an organisation that has many reputations. Moreover, Amadeo proposes the real example of the USA and get the statistical data from the USA BOP which showed by the US government which has the reputation and wants to show the truth to the people. On the other hand, she only gets the data from only one nation which is not representative enough and not wide to stand for the aspects of all countries.</p>
<p>​          In conclusion, I believe all countries will get benefits if they are involved in global trade instead of drawbacks,  meanwhile the process of claiming the drawbacks of international trade is more convincing than the procedure of proposing the benefits due to each evidence of the second paragraph used variable data and statistical figures. Moreover, in the first article, the author mentioned both of the positive sides and negative sides, therefore there is no selective evidence. But for Nergis’ s article, was published 9 years ago which was very old and cannot be as up-to-date as other authors’ article. Moreover, Nergis is the manager of a shipping company and she might have vested interest. Initially, from my perspective, I believe the global trade has more benefits but after evaluating the process of proving drawbacks of global trades. Further details like more exact primary evidence from the interview of more experts and people who live on global trade find it is better than the stages of proving the advantages of international trade</p>

            <h2 id="The-biggest-failure-I-experienced"><a href="#The-biggest-failure-I-experienced" class="headerlink" title="The biggest failure I experienced"></a>The biggest failure I experienced</h2><p>Failure, a simple thing that almost everyone faces in their life, including school life and future career but the important thing is how to extract experience from corresponding event. My biggest failure is what I faced in my high school life and I got a C in my IGCSE English as the second language. Before the IGCSE examination, our head teacher told us ESL is extreme important and almost as essential as the score of IELTS test. </p>
<p>  Before facing the real examination, I was very confident and I thought that I did not need any other revision because I think the test was very easy and I had got several A in the mock examinations. Because of this, I was always telling myself, this was no need to do ESL past paper. While I was doing the real IGCSE test, the listening part was the most difficult due to unknown English words and the lack of abilities to follow the speed of the speakers. When it came to the April 8th, I got the feedback of IGCSE and I checked as soon as I got it from my teacher. Sure enough， I fail to pass it and reason why I did not pass the exams was my scores of listening part and If I got a few more scores , I could get a B which is the grade that was able to pass the test which I did not take the resit . At that moment, I felt really   disappointed for myself, apart from the ESL, I got A* for almost all my subjects but ESL made me waste my previous efforts and time. So, I had no choice but to take it again in the next exam period. ( October and November) Moreover, I also needed to get a valid mark for the IELTS test so the time was extreme busy. I could not drop my high school study and ESL resit, meanwhile, For IELTS, I must get a valid (7) score or otherwise, I was able to submit the first application the universities in the UK. In fact, I regretted not to prepare for the ESL in PAL, if I do some of the preparation, the results might be different. Fortunately, I succeed in getting not only the valid grades for IELTS but also passing the ESL in resit, but for me it is better to do things carefully before you feel regretful.</p>

            <h1 id="My-biggest-academic-achievement"><a href="#My-biggest-academic-achievement" class="headerlink" title="My biggest academic achievement"></a>My biggest academic achievement</h1><p>​      Achievements are just like failure; We never know when they will come and what they are and it seems like both of them are unavoidable in every person’s life. My biggest achievement just happened in the last year in which I had got an amazing ranking in a competition called HELghten Critical Thinking Challenge. I did have several achievements at my middle school and primary school, but the reason why this achievement is the biggest and most extraordinary is that this is only time that defeated other competitors and I got into the national range rankings which is extremely difficult to achieve because of the competition</p>
<p>HELghten Critiical Thinking Challenge competition is just as its name suggests, this activity is set for testing the critical thinking skills of students. Obviously, critical thinking, a skill that help to distinguish the benefits and drawbacks of events, is extremely important in current society because every single thing that takes place around us might have both positive and negative sides. By contrast with other subjects like maths, critical thinking needs us not to chase for only one unchanged answer but for answers or solutions which are reasonable, for instance, the eruption of a volcano. Most people would only view the drawbacks of eruption while people who have critical thinking skills might be concerned about what benefits this is able to bring us. Therefore, the results were be carried on to find out the advantages of eruption and finally scientists would compare and contrast the effects of other volcanic eruptions and try to discover any benefits and the most commonly seen one is the eruption of volcanos can help to provide larger amount of resources like mineral resources that can be used for construction and volcanic ash that can be used to enrich the fertility level.</p>
<p>Before taking the exams, I even did not realise how difficult a skill critical thinking can be.  Most of the questions in tests are extreme tough and thus in almost every question, various factors are needed to be considered. Also every question seems to be based on real-life situations and it gives us the data and statistical data to analysis and distinguish the positive and negative effects. After finishing the exam, I was not as confident as others were and at that moment, I thought I had failed to pass that competition because other students seem like to be extremely cheerful about their tests and passion on communicating with others about the questions they had answered.</p>
<p>In March 2020, I received my feedback and unexpectedly I got the National Honour Award which is only given to the top 8 students in the country. I was so surprised and could not wait to share it with my friends and family members. As previously noted, achievements sometimes cannot be expected. Occasionally, failures will come despite the effects we exert on but try to be patient and persistent and finally we would meet the success.</p>

Just send your PS to your  English teachers and they will help you to change the mistakes and improve your grammar.    </p>
<p>So, is that the  only method that can help you adjust your PS </p>
<h3 id="Obviously-the-answer-is-NOT"><a href="#Obviously-the-answer-is-NOT" class="headerlink" title="Obviously , the answer is NOT"></a>Obviously , the answer is NOT</h3><p>There several tips that can help you (including me)  to improve our PS</p>
<p>The first one is just the get the help from the software (microsoft word ). Change the language mode into the British English mode which can automatically find you spelling mistakes and some of the grammar mistakes . From my first draft that I wrote , I did find some of the spelling mistakes that marked by red colour by the software and format mistake marked by the blue colour</p>
<p>The second one is make a plan of what you are going to write before going practicing. Honestly , in my first draft that sent to my teacher , there were lots of sentence that were not very logical which means there were no clearly connection between former sentence and next sentence. Thus , the teacher could not understand the meaning clearly . So, make sure you have already read your PS ,  microsoft  can not help you because it is not grammar or spelling mistakes .</p>

<h5 id="What-we-need-to-write-in-the-PS-and-what-is-the-most-important-part"><a href="#What-we-need-to-write-in-the-PS-and-what-is-the-most-important-part" class="headerlink" title="What we need to write in the PS ? and what is the most important part ?"></a>What we need to write in the PS ? and what is the most important part ?</h5><p>In general , we need to write different parts in our PS and from my perspective ,  academic performance , expectation and activities are 3 essential and activity part is the most significant component . </p>
<h3 id="What-we-need-to-write-in-our-activity-part"><a href="#What-we-need-to-write-in-our-activity-part" class="headerlink" title="What we need to write in our activity part"></a>What we need to write in our activity part</h3><p>Actually , it is not so difficult once we know how to relate our afterschool activities  to our ideal major or courses. Andrew , our PS teacher who from the UK tells us that we need to write down what we have done in high school life (a story that related to computer if your major is EE or programming)</p>
<p>Let us take a wrong example , one of friends named XXX has written his first draft of PS and his ideal major is environmental science . In his paragraph ,  he wrote much about the geography knowledge that his teacher told to him but not write about the reason that why he like environment science . Moreover,he did not write even anything about relationship between his major and activities. As a result of this , he received low marks for his first draft.</p>
<p>So , we can see that , finding a relationship between activities and major is extreme important!!!!!</p>
