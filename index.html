        <p>Hey, guys. Today I am going to show you some materials about studying and today’s subject is GPR essay.</p>
<p>This essay was my first essay which is written by myself. I know it is not very good, but this essay is extreme meaningful to me and for my future essay writing.  </p>
<h1 id="Is-the-global-trade-fair-enough-for-every-country"><a href="#Is-the-global-trade-fair-enough-for-every-country" class="headerlink" title="Is the global trade fair enough for every country?"></a>Is the global trade fair enough for every country?</h1><h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>​       Nowadays, trades between most countries has increased and global trade is the worldwide business that involves making and collecting payments for transactions in goods and services, and transporting them to interested markets”. (Business dictionary, n.d.)  This issue is important because some developing countries have suffered from the unfair retribution from selling their products to other nations .Currently, this trend has been become an irreversible process of human economic development.(and that is the reason why I chose it.)  Benefits such as importing goods which have high quality meanwhile it will also cause some serious problems like destruction of domestic producers and raising global poverty between in developing countries. Kimberly Amadeo, a woman president of WorldMoneyWatch, a firm which produces publications about the global economy proposes that global trade is unfair and probably leads to several problems. However, another woman called Nergis,   an Import Operations Manager at MTS Logistics suggests that global trade is extreme excellent for almost every nation.</p>
<p>Reasons why we need to maintain the global trade (part 1)</p>
<p>​        The first which is the most significant is that global trades can boost the variety of commodities and services. To be more specific, globalization can help the local citizens to know exotic cultures and foreign goods and no countries are now in self- sufficient. The author of the article “The Impact of Global Trade on Our Daily Lives” has posted a real example that the lamb you eat is from New Zealand, the sea food that you enjoy might come from Norway. The trades allow shipping firms to transport other countries ‘food like Japanese fish to satisfy the consumers’ demand and can provide sufficient goods for consumers to have .Of course, with the help of globalization, more people are now having better living condition which has variable choices of services and commodities and every nation which is involved in the trades can improve their economic circumstances and great ideas and invention can be shared by each country.” A fact that Amado mentioned is NAFTA, a free trade area between the United States, Canada, and Mexico. In this area, many commodities can be transported easily without restriction. Therefore, many companies might provide the thousand types of new goods in order to sell more and survive in the keen competition. An evidence from the online article “International Trade: Pros, Cons, and Effect on the Economy “and it says that Imports would add pressure on domestic producers so that they would lower the prices of goods and provide shoppers with a wider variety of goods and services, such as different types cars in order to attract more potential consumers (Amadeo, 2020). International trade provides different companies in different regions choose goods that producing the goods which they are good at producing. For instance, the firm which sited near the forest might be good at producing wooden products while the other firm which is constructed near the sea might have excellent fishing skills. Therefore, those firms can produce what they are good at and can have lower cost of production compared with producing both two goods by themselves. Thus, when it comes to a whole country, people in nation A can enjoy the goods at a lower price and a much higher quality from nation B and vice versa. “The Impact of Global Trade on Our Daily Lives” said “Personally, I love the idea of being able to find the ethnic ingredients of my mother’s favourite dish here in New York, thousands of miles away from its origin, sometimes for cheaper prices than in its local market.” The author Kimberly Amadeo, a person who has over 20 years of senior-level corporate experience in economic analysis, business strategy and graduated from the Sloan School of Business at MIT. She is a very experienced expert in the field of economics and business and it shows that she must have some related expertise to the topic of globalization. An expert in this field might have the abilities to select the proper evidence and choose the academic style. She showed us the real example of an outcome of the global trade which is NAFTA, this example is a fact and strength the topic. For the second author whose name is Nergis, a person who was the Import Operations Manager at MTS Logistics. She graduated from Istanbul University majoring in Tourism &amp; Hotel Management. Her major might be not relevant to the business and economics, but her job which was an import operation manager, she probably had relevant experience. However, her position which is a manager of shipping firm made herself might have vested interest. Being as manager of the shipping firm, she has the probability to say some things that are beneficial for her corporation. From her first opinion which is globalization can help the local citizens to enjoy the food come from other nations, other areas. But she did not use any other details to reinforce her perspective and just made assumptions by herself. However, she used her personal experience (primary evidence) to support her perspective.</p>
<p>The reasons that why some people do not believe the global trade</p>
<p>​       Everything has its dual characters, there are some of the drawbacks of the globalization. International business might destroy the domestic producers so that cause unemployment. In Kimberly Amadeo’s article, she pointed that “The only way boost exports are to make trade easier overall. Governments do this by reducing tariffs and other blocks to imports. That reduces jobs in domestic industries that can’t compete on a global scale, as well as leads to job outsourcing, which is when companies relocate call centres, technology offices, and manufacturing to countries with a lower cost of living.” One of example that she has mentioned is “United States has a trade deficit. In 2019, international trade subtracted $616 billion from GDP ﻿(Data on America’s import and export components show that goods and services purchased by the nation outweigh those which it sells on the global marketplace)”. In general, the trade deficit means the exports revenue less than the expenditure on imports. If this situation continues exits, it means domestic producers and workers are really weak due to its consumers mainly depends on imports instead of the domestic supply. Therefore, producers do not have sufficient profit to maintain the corporations so that they need to reduce the number of workers to decline the cost. Globalization means competitions between each producer. For several firms, they are not able to compete with the other business men who produce the identical goods at lower prices which we called the substitute. For another article called “negative effects of world trades” (Hall, 2017) , writer proposed that it will cause reduced wages and raising global poverty. “Labour represents one of the highest business costs in producing products. The EPI reported that expanded world trade – which opens markets to goods produced in countries where workers earn far less than their domestic competitors.” The domestic producers are now trying to reduce the cost of production in order to compete with the other foreign which produce identical goods. Obviously, the cost of employing workers and staff account for the most expenditure of production and many entrepreneurs have no choice but to reduce the wages for employees. Thus, employees might have lower financial conditions and worser living standards. Despite this problem, rising global poverty is another serious issue which many countries have. “The World Trade Organization and the World Bank report that the years since 1980 have seen the most growth in liberalized trade, in which international trading activities expand as trade barriers fall. However, world poverty has risen during that same period. The World Bank reports that the number of people throughout the world living on less than $2 a day has risen by about 50 percent since 1980. In addition, a growing number of people are living on less than $1 a day.” Written by Shane Hall (Hall, 2017). Part of the developing countries cannot produce their goods at a lower price compared with the developed nation who have skilled labour and advanced machines(capitals).Therefore, the domestic producers might get bankrupts and their circumstances are getting worsen and worser but by contrast , the producers in developed nations might get richer. Overall, Amadeo is a very experienced expert who has relevant expertise that we mention in the second paragraph. The author of the second article is a writer and analyst with over 20 years of experience and he also got a Doctor of Philosophy in the political economy and is a former college instructor of economics and political science. So，Shane Hall, might have expertise as well. For both of the writers, they have abilities to give logical explanation and they have applied quantitive data and figures to claim their topic and meanwhile Shane Hall cite the research of World Bank which is an organisation that has many reputations. Moreover, Amadeo proposes the real example of the USA and get the statistical data from the USA BOP which showed by the US government which has the reputation and wants to show the truth to the people. On the other hand, she only gets the data from only one nation which is not representative enough and not wide to stand for the aspects of all countries.</p>
<p>​          In conclusion, I believe all countries will get benefits if they are involved in global trade instead of drawbacks,  meanwhile the process of claiming the drawbacks of international trade is more convincing than the procedure of proposing the benefits due to each evidence of the second paragraph used variable data and statistical figures. Moreover, in the first article, the author mentioned both of the positive sides and negative sides, therefore there is no selective evidence. But for Nergis’ s article, was published 9 years ago which was very old and cannot be as up-to-date as other authors’ article. Moreover, Nergis is the manager of a shipping company and she might have vested interest. Initially, from my perspective, I believe the global trade has more benefits but after evaluating the process of proving drawbacks of global trades. Further details like more exact primary evidence from the interview of more experts and people who live on global trade find it is better than the stages of proving the advantages of international trade</p>

My biggest failure is what I faced in my high school life and I got a C in my IGCSE English as the second language. Before the IGCSE examination, our head teacher told us ESL is extreme important and almost as essential as the score of IELTS test. </p>
<p>  Before facing the real examination, I was very confident and I thought that I did not need any other revision because I think the test was very easy and I had got several A in the mock examinations. Because of this, I was always telling myself, this was no need to do ESL past paper. While I was doing the real IGCSE test, the listening part was the most difficult due to unknown English words and the lack of abilities to follow the speed of the speakers. When it came to the April 8th, I got the feedback of IGCSE and I checked as soon as I got it from my teacher. Sure enough， I fail to pass it and reason why I did not pass the exams was my scores of listening part and If I got a few more scores , I could get a B which is the grade that was able to pass the test which I did not take the resit . At that moment, I felt really   disappointed for myself, apart from the ESL, I got A* for almost all my subjects but ESL made me waste my previous efforts and time. So, I had no choice but to take it again in the next exam period. ( October and November) Moreover, I also needed to get a valid mark for the IELTS test so the time was extreme busy. I could not drop my high school study and ESL resit, meanwhile, For IELTS, I must get a valid (7) score or otherwise, I was able to submit the first application the universities in the UK. In fact, I regretted not to prepare for the ESL in PAL, if I do some of the preparation, the results might be different. Fortunately, I succeed in getting not only the valid grades for IELTS but also passing the ESL in resit, but for me it is better to do things carefully before you feel regretful.</p>

        <h1 id="My-biggest-academic-achievement"><a href="#My-biggest-academic-achievement" class="headerlink" title="My biggest academic achievement"></a>My biggest academic achievement</h1><p>​      Achievements are just like failure; We never know when they will come and what they are and it seems like both of them are unavoidable in every person’s life. My biggest achievement just happened in the last year in which I had got an amazing ranking in a competition called HELghten Critical Thinking Challenge. I did have several achievements at my middle school and primary school, but the reason why this achievement is the biggest and most extraordinary is that this is only time that defeated other competitors and I got into the national range rankings which is extremely difficult to achieve because of the competition</p>
<p>HELghten Critiical Thinking Challenge competition is just as its name suggests, this activity is set for testing the critical thinking skills of students. Obviously, critical thinking, a skill that help to distinguish the benefits and drawbacks of events, is extremely important in current society because every single thing that takes place around us might have both positive and negative sides. By contrast with other subjects like maths, critical thinking needs us not to chase for only one unchanged answer but for answers or solutions which are reasonable, for instance, the eruption of a volcano. Most people would only view the drawbacks of eruption while people who have critical thinking skills might be concerned about what benefits this is able to bring us. Therefore, the results were be carried on to find out the advantages of eruption and finally scientists would compare and contrast the effects of other volcanic eruptions and try to discover any benefits and the most commonly seen one is the eruption of volcanos can help to provide larger amount of resources like mineral resources that can be used for construction and volcanic ash that can be used to enrich the fertility level.</p>
<p>Before taking the exams, I even did not realise how difficult a skill critical thinking can be.  Most of the questions in tests are extreme tough and thus in almost every question, various factors are needed to be considered. Also every question seems to be based on real-life situations and it gives us the data and statistical data to analysis and distinguish the positive and negative effects. After finishing the exam, I was not as confident as others were and at that moment, I thought I had failed to pass that competition because other students seem like to be extremely cheerful about their tests and passion on communicating with others about the questions they had answered.</p>
<p>In March 2020, I received my feedback and unexpectedly I got the National Honour Award which is only given to the top 8 students in the country. I was so surprised and could not wait to share it with my friends and family members. As previously noted, achievements sometimes cannot be expected. Occasionally, failures will come despite the effects we exert on but try to be patient and persistent and finally we would meet the success.</p>

Just send your PS to your  English teachers and they will help you to change the mistakes and improve your grammar.    </p>
<p>So, is that the  only method that can help you adjust your PS </p>
<h3 id="Obviously-the-answer-is-NOT"><a href="#Obviously-the-answer-is-NOT" class="headerlink" title="Obviously , the answer is NOT"></a>Obviously , the answer is NOT</h3><p>There several tips that can help you (including me)  to improve our PS</p>
<p>The first one is just the get the help from the software (microsoft word ). Change the language mode into the British English mode which can automatically find you spelling mistakes and some of the grammar mistakes . From my first draft that I wrote , I did find some of the spelling mistakes that marked by red colour by the software and format mistake marked by the blue colour</p>
<p>The second one is make a plan of what you are going to write before going practicing. Honestly , in my first draft that sent to my teacher , there were lots of sentence that were not very logical which means there were no clearly connection between former sentence and next sentence. Thus , the teacher could not understand the meaning clearly . So, make sure you have already read your PS ,  microsoft  can not help you because it is not grammar or spelling mistakes .</p>

<h3 id="What-we-need-to-write-in-our-activity-part"><a href="#What-we-need-to-write-in-our-activity-part" class="headerlink" title="What we need to write in our activity part"></a>What we need to write in our activity part</h3><p>Actually , it is not so difficult once we know how to relate our afterschool activities  to our ideal major or courses. Andrew , our PS teacher who from the UK tells us that we need to write down what we have done in high school life (a story that related to computer if your major is EE or programming)</p>
<p>Let us take a wrong example , one of friends named XXX has written his first draft of PS and his ideal major is environmental science . In his paragraph ,  he wrote much about the geography knowledge that his teacher told to him but not write about the reason that why he like environment science . Moreover,he did not write even anything about relationship between his major and activities. As a result of this , he received low marks for his first draft.</p>
<p>So , we can see that , finding a relationship between activities and major is extreme important!!!!!</p>

<p>​        <strong>Hey guys , nice to see you again and this is my second article .Happy new year and happy Chinese new year . I am sure that you guys are interested in learning knowledge which related to computer science . I know , that the favourite of almost every boy who like science subjects, even me , a young man who are now trying to learn a programming language called python.</strong></p>

<h3 id="Body-paragraph"><a href="#Body-paragraph" class="headerlink" title="Body paragraph"></a>Body paragraph</h3><p>I know , that the favourite of almost every boy who like science subjects, even me , a young man who are now trying to learn a programming language called python.<br>Obviously,python is one of the greatest programming languages in the world, I was exposed to the world of computers when I first enter the high school. Visual basic is the first language that I have used till nowadays, but at that time I have no choice but to give up due to the IGCSE final exam (I did not get much time that could be spent on doing further study on computer science. Even in year 2 of my high school , I chose economic instead of learning CS.) After that , I decided to learn the basic knowledge about another programming language called C++ which was also a very nice  development of computers. </p>
<h3 id="Expectation"><a href="#Expectation" class="headerlink" title="Expectation"></a>Expectation</h3><ul>
<li><p>What I expect is that python is CS language that is the most convenient language. This kind of  invention can be applied to many different circumstances like classifying statistical data and figures or even can be used to build up model easily . I hope that python is just like its name, a language which is as strong and powerful as “python”</p>

        <p>#<strong><em>Introduction</em></strong></p>
<p>​      Hey guys, this is my first article that I actually write about myself. My name is Liukai (Charles for my English name) Today’s topic is about my conclusion for my second year of my high school life. Actually I my class is a little bit different from the normal high school students in China , I am now studying in the    international department in Jingling High School .  In todays article I would like to talk about 2 main points which conclusion and expectation respectively.</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><h1 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a><strong><em>Conclusion</em></strong></h1><p>The winter holiday is now coming , the first of second year will end in the next few weeks. Actually , I have just finished my end-term examinations， including   Pure maths , physics, economics and chemistry. In fact , chemistry and physics are my weakness while the other two subjects are my strengths. As a student who decide to study abroad , excellent  academic  performance is significantly important compared with other characteristics that a freshman who study overseas. Working and dealing things by myself is also essential for me to learn, what I have expected now is that doing some voluntary jobs in the winter holiday  during the Spring Festival . Being as a volunteer , I can develop the skills of communication.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>#<strong><em>Expectations</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from this ，it is now very significant for me to decide which country I need to go when I graduate from my school ，till now ，<u>my first choice is UK and the second choice is just the Canada </u></u>( That are what usually my classmates choose) .In fact , I do decide to choose a major which is relevant to the economics ( profitable and not brain-consuming for me ),but I have found that science subjects are my cups of tea which what I am interested in . So in conclusion , science subjects like maths are what I am keen on. The marks of my final exam are coming soon. Good luck   ,  Charles you can make it！</p>
