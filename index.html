        <h1 id="My-biggest-academic-achievement"><a href="#My-biggest-academic-achievement" class="headerlink" title="My biggest academic achievement"></a>My biggest academic achievement</h1><p>​      Achievements are just like failure; We never know when they will come and what they are and it seems like both of them are unavoidable in every person’s life. My biggest achievement just happened in the last year in which I had got an amazing ranking in a competition called HELghten Critical Thinking Challenge. I did have several achievements at my middle school and primary school, but the reason why this achievement is the biggest and most extraordinary is that this is only time that defeated other competitors and I got into the national range rankings which is extremely difficult to achieve because of the competition</p>
<p>HELghten Critiical Thinking Challenge competition is just as its name suggests, this activity is set for testing the critical thinking skills of students. Obviously, critical thinking, a skill that help to distinguish the benefits and drawbacks of events, is extremely important in current society because every single thing that takes place around us might have both positive and negative sides. By contrast with other subjects like maths, critical thinking needs us not to chase for only one unchanged answer but for answers or solutions which are reasonable, for instance, the eruption of a volcano. Most people would only view the drawbacks of eruption while people who have critical thinking skills might be concerned about what benefits this is able to bring us. Therefore, the results were be carried on to find out the advantages of eruption and finally scientists would compare and contrast the effects of other volcanic eruptions and try to discover any benefits and the most commonly seen one is the eruption of volcanos can help to provide larger amount of resources like mineral resources that can be used for construction and volcanic ash that can be used to enrich the fertility level.</p>
<p>Before taking the exams, I even did not realise how difficult a skill critical thinking can be.  Most of the questions in tests are extreme tough and thus in almost every question, various factors are needed to be considered. Also every question seems to be based on real-life situations and it gives us the data and statistical data to analysis and distinguish the positive and negative effects. After finishing the exam, I was not as confident as others were and at that moment, I thought I had failed to pass that competition because other students seem like to be extremely cheerful about their tests and passion on communicating with others about the questions they had answered.</p>
<p>In March 2020, I received my feedback and unexpectedly I got the National Honour Award which is only given to the top 8 students in the country. I was so surprised and could not wait to share it with my friends and family members. As previously noted, achievements sometimes cannot be expected. Occasionally, failures will come despite the effects we exert on but try to be patient and persistent and finally we would meet the success.</p>

Just send your PS to your  English teachers and they will help you to change the mistakes and improve your grammar.    </p>
<p>So, is that the  only method that can help you adjust your PS </p>
<h3 id="Obviously-the-answer-is-NOT"><a href="#Obviously-the-answer-is-NOT" class="headerlink" title="Obviously , the answer is NOT"></a>Obviously , the answer is NOT</h3><p>There several tips that can help you (including me)  to improve our PS</p>
<p>The first one is just the get the help from the software (microsoft word ). Change the language mode into the British English mode which can automatically find you spelling mistakes and some of the grammar mistakes . From my first draft that I wrote , I did find some of the spelling mistakes that marked by red colour by the software and format mistake marked by the blue colour</p>
<p>The second one is make a plan of what you are going to write before going practicing. Honestly , in my first draft that sent to my teacher , there were lots of sentence that were not very logical which means there were no clearly connection between former sentence and next sentence. Thus , the teacher could not understand the meaning clearly . So, make sure you have already read your PS ,  microsoft  can not help you because it is not grammar or spelling mistakes .</p>

<h3 id="What-we-need-to-write-in-our-activity-part"><a href="#What-we-need-to-write-in-our-activity-part" class="headerlink" title="What we need to write in our activity part"></a>What we need to write in our activity part</h3><p>Actually , it is not so difficult once we know how to relate our afterschool activities  to our ideal major or courses. Andrew , our PS teacher who from the UK tells us that we need to write down what we have done in high school life (a story that related to computer if your major is EE or programming)</p>
<p>Let us take a wrong example , one of friends named XXX has written his first draft of PS and his ideal major is environmental science . In his paragraph ,  he wrote much about the geography knowledge that his teacher told to him but not write about the reason that why he like environment science . Moreover,he did not write even anything about relationship between his major and activities. As a result of this , he received low marks for his first draft.</p>
<p>So , we can see that , finding a relationship between activities and major is extreme important!!!!!</p>

<p>​        <strong>Hey guys , nice to see you again and this is my second article .Happy new year and happy Chinese new year . I am sure that you guys are interested in learning knowledge which related to computer science . I know , that the favourite of almost every boy who like science subjects, even me , a young man who are now trying to learn a programming language called python.</strong></p>

<h3 id="Body-paragraph"><a href="#Body-paragraph" class="headerlink" title="Body paragraph"></a>Body paragraph</h3><p>I know , that the favourite of almost every boy who like science subjects, even me , a young man who are now trying to learn a programming language called python.<br>Obviously,python is one of the greatest programming languages in the world, I was exposed to the world of computers when I first enter the high school. Visual basic is the first language that I have used till nowadays, but at that time I have no choice but to give up due to the IGCSE final exam (I did not get much time that could be spent on doing further study on computer science. Even in year 2 of my high school , I chose economic instead of learning CS.) After that , I decided to learn the basic knowledge about another programming language called C++ which was also a very nice  development of computers. </p>
<h3 id="Expectation"><a href="#Expectation" class="headerlink" title="Expectation"></a>Expectation</h3><ul>
<li><p>What I expect is that python is CS language that is the most convenient language. This kind of  invention can be applied to many different circumstances like classifying statistical data and figures or even can be used to build up model easily . I hope that python is just like its name, a language which is as strong and powerful as “python”</p>

        <p>#<strong><em>Introduction</em></strong></p>
<p>​      Hey guys, this is my first article that I actually write about myself. My name is Liukai (Charles for my English name) Today’s topic is about my conclusion for my second year of my high school life. Actually I my class is a little bit different from the normal high school students in China , I am now studying in the    international department in Jingling High School .  In todays article I would like to talk about 2 main points which conclusion and expectation respectively.</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><h1 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a><strong><em>Conclusion</em></strong></h1><p>The winter holiday is now coming , the first of second year will end in the next few weeks. Actually , I have just finished my end-term examinations， including   Pure maths , physics, economics and chemistry. In fact , chemistry and physics are my weakness while the other two subjects are my strengths. As a student who decide to study abroad , excellent  academic  performance is significantly important compared with other characteristics that a freshman who study overseas. Working and dealing things by myself is also essential for me to learn, what I have expected now is that doing some voluntary jobs in the winter holiday  during the Spring Festival . Being as a volunteer , I can develop the skills of communication.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>#<strong><em>Expectations</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from this ，it is now very significant for me to decide which country I need to go when I graduate from my school ，till now ，<u>my first choice is UK and the second choice is just the Canada </u></u>( That are what usually my classmates choose) .In fact , I do decide to choose a major which is relevant to the economics ( profitable and not brain-consuming for me ),but I have found that science subjects are my cups of tea which what I am interested in . So in conclusion , science subjects like maths are what I am keen on. The marks of my final exam are coming soon. Good luck   ,  Charles you can make it！</p>
