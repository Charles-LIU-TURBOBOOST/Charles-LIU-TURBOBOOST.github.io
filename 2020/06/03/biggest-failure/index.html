        <h2 id="The-biggest-failure-I-experienced"><a href="#The-biggest-failure-I-experienced" class="headerlink" title="The biggest failure I experienced"></a>The biggest failure I experienced</h2><p>Failure, a simple thing that almost everyone faces in their life, including school life and future career but the important thing is how to extract experience from corresponding event. My biggest failure is what I faced in my high school life and I got a C in my IGCSE English as the second language. Before the IGCSE examination, our head teacher told us ESL is extreme important and almost as essential as the score of IELTS test. </p>
<p>  Before facing the real examination, I was very confident and I thought that I did not need any other revision because I think the test was very easy and I had got several A in the mock examinations. Because of this, I was always telling myself, this was no need to do ESL past paper. While I was doing the real IGCSE test, the listening part was the most difficult due to unknown English words and the lack of abilities to follow the speed of the speakers. When it came to the April 8th, I got the feedback of IGCSE and I checked as soon as I got it from my teacher. Sure enoughï¼Œ I fail to pass it and reason why I did not pass the exams was my scores of listening part and If I got a few more scores , I could get a B which is the grade that was able to pass the test which I did not take the resit . At that moment, I felt really   disappointed for myself, apart from the ESL, I got A* for almost all my subjects but ESL made me waste my previous efforts and time. So, I had no choice but to take it again in the next exam period. ( October and November) Moreover, I also needed to get a valid mark for the IELTS test so the time was extreme busy. I could not drop my high school study and ESL resit, meanwhile, For IELTS, I must get a valid (7) score or otherwise, I was able to submit the first application the universities in the UK. In fact, I regretted not to prepare for the ESL in PAL, if I do some of the preparation, the results might be different. Fortunately, I succeed in getting not only the valid grades for IELTS but also passing the ESL in resit, but for me it is better to do things carefully before you feel regretful.</p>
